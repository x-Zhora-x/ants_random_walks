# 🐜 Random Walk Simulator with Ants 🐜

## Project Overview

🐜This interactive simulation lets you observe the behavior of ants as they randomly walk around, searching for food and carrying it back to their nest. You have full control over the environment, allowing you to tweak settings, add or remove food sources, and change how the ants look on screen. 

## 🕹️ Features

1. **Interactive Simulation Controls**:
   - **Add Food Mode**: Click on the canvas to place new food sources.
   - **Remove Food Mode**: Remove previously placed food sources
   - **Draw Mode**: If bugs aren't your thing, you can switch the display from ants to simple arrows.

2. **Adjustable Settings**:
   - **Ant Count Slider**: Choose how many ants you want to watch (from 50 to 150).
   - **Speed Slider**: Control how fast the ants move.

3. **Dynamic Visuals**:
   - The ants are drawn with distinct body parts and even change color when carrying food back to the nest.
   - Food sources have scent circles around them, showing how ants detect and move toward food.

4. **Guided Tutorial**:
   - New to the simulation? No problem! A friendly tutorial will walk you through everything you need to know when you start up
