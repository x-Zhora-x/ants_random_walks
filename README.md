# 🐜 Random Walk Simulator with Ants 🐜

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Random Walk Simulator with Ants**! 🐜✨ This fun and interactive simulation lets you observe the fascinating behavior of ants as they scuttle around, searching for food and carrying it back to their nest. You have full control over the environment, allowing you to tweak settings, add or remove food sources, and even change how the ants look on screen. Ready to dive in and see how ants navigate their tiny world? Let's get started!

## 🕹️ Features

1. **Interactive Simulation Controls**:
   - **Pause & Resume**: Need a break? Pause the simulation and pick up right where you left off.
   - **Add Food Mode**: Click on the canvas to place new food sources. Watch the ants rush over!
   - **Remove Food Mode**: Want to remove a food source? Simply click near it, and it's gone.
   - **Reset**: Start fresh whenever you like with the reset button.
   - **Draw Mode**: If bugs aren't your thing, you can switch the display from ants to simple arrows.

2. **Adjustable Settings**:
   - **Ant Count Slider**: Choose how many ants you want to watch (from 50 to 150).
   - **Speed Slider**: Control how fast the ants move. Go from a leisurely pace to speedy scurrying!

3. **Dynamic Visuals**:
   - The ants are drawn with distinct body parts and even change color when carrying food back to the nest.
   - Food sources have scent circles around them, showing how ants detect and move toward food.

4. **Guided Tutorial**:
   - New to the simulation? No problem! A friendly tutorial will walk you through everything you need to know when you start up.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You only need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to run this simulation. No other software is required.

### Running the Simulation
1. **Download** or **clone** the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
3. Sit back and let the tutorial guide you through all the features.

### Tutorial Highlights
When you open the simulation, you'll see a step-by-step tutorial to get you up to speed:
- **Pause & Resume**: Control when the ants move and when they take a breather.
- **Add/Remove Food**: Easily add or remove food sources by clicking on the canvas.
- **Reset**: Restart the simulation whenever you want.
- **Draw Mode**: Switch between a bug-free view (arrows) or stick with the cute little ants.
- **Adjust Ant Count & Speed**: Use sliders to change the number and speed of the ants.

## 📂 Project Files
- `index.html`: Main file for the webpage and tutorial setup.
- `antscript.js`: JavaScript code controlling the ants' behavior and simulation logic.
- `style.css`: Optional file for additional styling.

## 🔍 How It Works

The ants have a simple behavior: they wander around, randomly changing direction every so often. If they detect a food source within a certain range, they move straight toward it. After picking up food, they head straight back to the nest. Once the food is safely delivered, the ant resumes its foraging.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
Some ideas for future updates:
- Adding more realistic behaviors like pheromone trails.
- Introducing obstacles and more diverse environments.
- Creating different species of ants with unique traits.
- Enhancing the visuals for an even more engaging experience.
